# Iterative-Gauss
My first repository! I wrote these programs to help solve my assignments quicker.
<br>
This contains three programs written in python. 
<ul>
  <li>Gauss-Seidel
  <li>Successive Over Relaxation to solve system of equations
  <li>Steepest-Descent to minimize a function of 2 or 3 variables.
</ul>  

# How to run
Clone the repository using 

```
git clone https://github.com/Sushmey/Iterative-Gauss.git
cd Iterative-Gauss
```
Run each program like a normal python program.
```
python3 SOR.py
```
<h3> To run the Steepest_descent_method.py program make sure you install the dependency first </h3>

```
pip3 install sympy
```
Now you can run it like a normal python program
